# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started hex-to-dec cmd convert and a blog project in Go.

**Thoughts:** The hex-to-dec wasn't so interesting as a project, so I decided to start a different one: a go-written blog.
            I think I should get better in error handling, because sometimes I'm not sure of what's happining behind.

### Day 2: December 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Today I made the first mysql<->go connection and implemented some "test" functions for it.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck in a shadowed variable bug... At last I found that I was redefining DB inside main, so the global db variable was untouched.

-----

### Day 3: December 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Implemented a simple login function in go-n-blog

**Thoughts:** It has been more difficult than I thought. I have to remember to always call row.Next() when I do a query.

### Day 4: December 19, 2017

-----

### Day 7: December 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Angular as frontend: styling, article models, inserted comments and others structures.

**Thoughts:** I'm finding the re-organizing data counter quite difficult, as I don't know typescript enough. Maybe it's better to delegate the info creation to the server API.

### Day 15: December 30, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Angular as frontend: fixed QuillJS!. Started a new go project: Snake game on terminal, 
based on [plutov's go-snake-telnet](https://github.com/plutov/go-snake-telnet).

**Thoughts:** Working so much on Angular I was risking to neglect Golang, so I've decided to start a parallel project of a Snake game clone on terminal.

### Day 21: January 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Angular as frontend. Today I'm back to Angular and I've added validations on all forms.

-----

### Day 23: January 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as backend. Implemented fetchArticle as RESTful api for frontend.

**Thoughts:** I've had some troubles getting the db connected. In the end I found I was using `defer db.Close()` inside init(), so when main arrived, db was already closed. Fortunately gorm has error handling methods, so you can know what's wrong.

-----

### Day 26: January 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as backend. Removed cache.

**Thoughts:** Not very productive today, I don't understand how [gin cache](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cache/) works, I should probably ask in the repo.

-----

### Day 27: January 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as backend. Replaced gin with julien schmidt's httprouter.

**Thoughts:** I removed gin because at the end I was using only the JSON function of the framework, so I implemented my own and removed it. I started studying how caches work and how to implement them in a golang server.

-----

### Day 28: January 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as backend. Implemented cache for restful service.

**Thoughts:** I built a simple cache for restful service, so we can avoid some calls to the database.

-----

### Day 29: January 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as backend. Implemented other methods of API: articles list and article sidebar count.

### Day 31: January 15, 2018

**Thoughts:** This is a very interesting topic, I want to handle it quite in depth.

-----

### Day 32: January 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as backend. Replaced httprouter with httptreemux and wrote a generic GET middleware.

**Thoughts:** I replaced the router because httptreemux's one uses http.HandlerFunc, passing URL parameter as a handy map\[string]string in request context. This gives me the possibility to use external functions designed for net/http package without the need to change anything. It has groups too, so code is more organized and middleware-friendly.

### Day 36: January 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Go as restful backend. Built login function returning jwt.

### Day 41: January 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Studied how to implement C structures in Go and inserted delete article function.
