# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started hex-to-dec cmd convert and a blog project in Go.

**Thoughts:** The hex-to-dec wasn't so interesting as a project, so I decided to start a different one: a go-written blog.
            I think I should get better in error handling, because sometimes I'm not sure of what's happining behind.

### Day 2: December 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Today I made the first mysql<->go connection and implemented some "test" functions for it.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck in a shadowed variable bug... At last I found that I was redefining DB inside main, so the global db variable was untouched.
